HTML emails is that tables are the only things that are universally supported when it comes to email design.
CSS is written with inline style tags,




Email Container Width:
Foundation for Emails' default container with around 600px wide. That's because the majority of email clients have a preview pane that is around 550-700 pixels.



Table tr td vs row column
The <table> tag wraps the entire table. The <tr> tag denotes a row. The <td> tag is used to wrap a table cell.




Id and Class
Speaking of CSS, you should only set classes and IDs on tables or <td> tags, not <tr> tags.




Margin and Padding
Outlook 2007, 2010, and 2013 does not support "padding" in <p>, <div> or <a> tags. Use margin instead.
Forget about using CSS positioning like top, bottom, relative, absolute.
margin is universally supported BUT you may see some inconsistencies in Outlook 2007, 2010, and 2013. Padding is safer.

Outlook.com does support margin with a capital "M". Use it like this:
margin: 10px;
Margin: 10px;  // fallback for Outlook.com





Break
<br> tags are ok, but you won't get pixel perfect results
Your best option for vertical spacing is to use the <spacer> component in Foundation for Emails. It works consistently on all email clients and lets you set the height with the size attribute. So <spacer size="32"></spacer> will create 32px of vertical space.





Colors:
It's better to use full 6 digit hex codes colors in HTML emails (#ffffff vs #fff)
Background colors work across all email clients as well as color for fonts.





JavaScript
Nope. JavaScript is not a reality in most popular emails. It will be blocked for security reasons.





Image
Many email clients block images by default. “Many” being pretty much everybody except Apple Mail/iOS and Gmail.
So we should Always use an ALT tag.

Outlook and Thunderbird like to show images in their ahem full glory.
The solution is inline size attributes.
<img height=“390” width=“580” src=“hero.jpg” alt=“I can be your hero, baby…” />
Remember to use full paths to images, not relative paths. (e.g. http://www.yourserver.com/email/images/logo.gif).
link to images from your own server, not anyone elses. If you don't control it you never know when that url will change.

Gif's and Video in Emails
Animated GIFs have surprisingly good support. Outlook only shows the first frame of the animation.

Video's in emails are not supported except in Apple Mail and Outlook 2011




Images for Buttons
Images get blocked. So if you have an important CTA image that looks like a button, it will likely get missed. And that defeats the purpose of your email.





Email File Size
Sending an email with a file size between 15KB-100KB is ideal. Some email clients will send the email to spam if the file size is greater.
Making the HTML file size less than 20kb (20540 characters) - not including images or the plain-text version. 
This charachter count includes things like inline styles, HTML tags, and spaces, and other HTML entities.

Create emails that are short and to the point. Too many call-to-actions's, topics, or long emails don't tend to work that well anyways.
Minify your HTML. 





Font Size
Text should never be smaller than 11 pixels.
Apple suggests 17px for mobile devices and Google recommends up to 21px for body copy.
So its better to use 16px font-size for email template.
